# Synchodoku

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/xfbs/synchrodoku.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/xfbs/synchrodoku)

This is a (pretty crazy) experiment to write
a sudoku solver in C that uses message-passing
concurrency instead of doing a na√Øve recursive approach
or using traditional state-sharing concurrency.

## How does it work?

The idea is that there is a thread pool and a
manager, with the thread pool doing the actual
solving and the manager passing on tasks to
the solver threads and receiving data from
them.
